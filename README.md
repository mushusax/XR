xr $ threejs. Goal is to view mathematica objects in threejs.

Goal: XRDeploy takes an image from a mathematica notebook, exports the image in a format that can be rendered to the web as VR or AR using a mathematica package that can be used from the notebook itself

Where we are:
.wrl images or .obj images can be rendered in VR using three.js
However images exported from Mathematica cannot be rendered.
